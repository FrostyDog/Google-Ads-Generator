                    <h3> Who needs Ad Generators?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p> This generator was made for both <b>Novice advertisers</b> and <b>marketing experts</b>:
                    <ul><b>Novice advertisers</b>, who have no previous experience with writing any kind of text ads
                        for
                        "Google Ads". <b>Ads Generator</b> would give you a fast and decent start. Because most of the
                        important tasks are already done, and you can concentrate on more important tasks with your
                        bussiness. </ul>

                    <ul><b>Experienced marketers and agencies</b>, could have a significant boost of their workflow, no
                        matter how many projects, products or locations you have.</ul>

                    <h3>I see only generator for Google Ads. More coming?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>For now concentration is on Google Ads. It is highly possible that in the future more generators for
                    other platform would come up.</p>

                <summary>
                    <h3> Ads have same information?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p> Ads would have some similar information in them, but it is highly unlikely that you would have
                    exactly
                    the same ad. Similarity and some difference in them would give you an area to test your
                    advertisements, and know what is working better for you. </p>

                    <h3>Why do I need different "Ad group" and "Campaign" generated?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p> Digital marketing is all about testing and looking what works or not. Since Ads have similar but not
                    exactly 100% same info, after some time of testing, you can easily tell
                    what is working better for you, and what is not. Making a structure in your account - helps to do
                    such a
                    thing
