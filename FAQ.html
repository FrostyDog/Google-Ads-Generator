            <h3> Who needs Ad Generators?</h3>
            <p> This generator was made for both <b>Novie advertisers</b> and <b>marketing experts</b>:
                <ul><b>Novice advertisers</b>, who have no previous experience with writting any kind of text ads for
                    "Google Ads". <b>Ads Generator</b> would give you a fast and decent start. Because most of the
                    important tasks are already done, and you can concentrate on more important tasks with your
                    bussiness. </ul>

                <ul><b>Experienced marketers and agencies</b>, could have a significant boost of their workflow, no
                    matter how many projects, products or locations you have.</ul>

                <br> This Generator allows you to builds <b>skeleton</b> of Ads dedicated to your company.
                Generated ads suppose to give you some general ideas, so you can than add your very specific details,
                and launch a good quality Ads.
            </p>
            <h3>I see only generator for Google Ads. More coming?</h3>
            <p>For now concentration is on Google Ads. It is highly possible that in the future more generators for
                other platform would come up.</p>
            <h3> Ads have same information?</h3>
            <p> Ads would have some simular information in them, but it is highly unlikely that you would have exactly
                the same ad. </p>
            <h3>Would same information affect my quality score?</h3>
            <p> No, read more about Quality Score on <a
                    href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/156066#QSvAR">Google Support</a> </p>
            <h3>Why do I need different "Ad group" and "Campaign" generated</h3>
            <p> Digital marketing is all about testing and looking what works or not. Since Ads have simular but not
                exactly 100% same info, after some time of testing, you can easily tell
                what is working better for you, and what is not. Making a structure in you account - helps to do such a
                thing
            </p>
            <h3> Who is developer? </h3>
            <p> The whole project is developed by one indepandant developer/marketer, which happends to be me.
                You can easily contact me for any topics via "support" button in the menu or simple drop me a text on <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/Frostdog_It"> Twitter</a> </p>

            <h3>Is project connected to Google or any other third-party company?</h3>
            <p> No. Project is fully independent, and should not be assosiated with any Third Party Company (ex. Google)
            </p>

            <h3> Is there are support for Ad Generators?</h3>
            <P> Yes. It is fully supported at the moment and there would be future updates with new kind of features and
                impovements.</P>
